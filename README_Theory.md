OOP Concepts In Java  

Inheritance

When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two 
categories:
1.subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
2.superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.



Polymorphism

If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.
In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc.



Abstraction

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.



Encapsulation

Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.

The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:
declare class variables/attributes as private
provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable
